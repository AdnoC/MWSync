MWSync
======

This is a tool to sync MangaWatcher (http://www.manga-watcher.com/) and MyAnimeList
(http://www.myanimelist.net). It will sync read mangas from a MW account to one's MAL account.

Status: Fully funcional command line interface

### Todo:
* Create a gui.
* Fix showing dropped items 
* Save search resolutions so that repeat syncs are faster.
* Add a check before updating to make sure you aren't setting MAL read chapters to a smaller value
  than is already set.
* Clean up all the sloppy coding I did in terms of multi-threading
* Write comments for EVERYTHING
